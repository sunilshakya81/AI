o	Medium: Calculator, group_by.
o	Hard: REPL with variables.
‚Ä¢	Mini Project: Build a text analyzer that reads a file, counts words, finds top-k frequent words, and exports JSON.
 
Week 2: Functions & OOP
‚Ä¢	Topics: Functions, closures, decorators, OOP basics.
‚Ä¢	Assignments:
o	Decorators, memoization, function dispatch.
o	Shapes hierarchy, plugin system.
